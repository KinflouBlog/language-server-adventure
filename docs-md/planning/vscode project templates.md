# Templates Generator
Making template generators for yeoman seems rather simple, so i might
make a generator for language extensions at some points


Options for ideas would be:
 - Language Grammar Support
 - Language Client + Language Server connections(Pipes, WebSocket, etc)


Important aspects to put into these ideas:
 - launch.json configuration of workspaces opening a "dev test" ephemeral folder on extension host debug
 - a watch script for changes
 - something else you might remember
