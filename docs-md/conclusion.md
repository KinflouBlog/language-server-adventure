# Conclusion

Making all the components for an optimal language experience is
an extensive task, but hopefully at the end of this guide, you
managed to do what you needed 😄

Here's a little [song to enjoy the moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCjyo2oC-ig).


Writting this guide took a good chunk of time, effort and knowledge,
if you liked and can, 
*[consider offering me a coffee (donation/tip)](https://ko-fi.com/kinflow)*
or maybe more, so I can keep writting more content in the future.

Good luck and have a nice day 🌻☀️
