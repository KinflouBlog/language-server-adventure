# Setting Up

Lets start by making a new cargo project
```Shell
> cargo new my-langserver
```

And for the crates lets go with:
- [tower-lsp](https://crates.io/crates/tower-lsp) which has some good face value examples
- [ariadne](https://crates.io/crates/ariadne) for formatting output of analysis, diagnostics, and so on
