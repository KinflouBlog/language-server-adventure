# A Language, Server and Friends Adventure

So for a while I have been into language development, sometimes to help
coming up with niche DSLs that can be useful, other times to just complement
already existing ones, having sometimes a bit of fun (and another times being lost ðŸ˜†)


And for a lot of the resources I went through, there was either a lot of the
robotic feeling of Â»how-to instructions whole guidesÂ«, or just a lot of code
to see, which is of course a lot resourceful but also feels quite overwhelming

In this guide I won't be going too much into theory or philosophy, this is more like a hands-on
guide for those who want to get going, with that said...

__*Lets begin !*__


> __Rant__ (skippable): Also doesn't help at all when way too often a slight piece of understanding is missing
and the ADHD brain just *clicks* and starts looking for the ideal and "perfect" solutions,
and for that I thought to myself:
"mmhh well what if I try to just list the most i can by segments that can be easier to access
even for me when I'm on ADHD mode or just Â»looking for the "perfect" context pieceÂ«",
and so with that I started writing this guide.
