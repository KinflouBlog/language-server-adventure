# Setting up

For the language server project we are going to need
a few things:
 - __[The Language Server Protocol Spec](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/)__ open in another screen
 - A language to do the project in (you can pick some from the subchapters on the left menu)


For me, I went with Rust for the language server, but still checking out
code examples in another languages if I didn't get entirely satisfied,
so you can do the same.
