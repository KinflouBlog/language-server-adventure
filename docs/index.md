# A Language Server Adventure

So for quite a while I have been into language development, sometimes to help
coming up with niche DSLs that can be useful, other times to just complement
already existing ones, having sometimes a bit of fun (and another times nightmares)


And for a lot of the resources I went through, there was either a lot of the
robotic feeling of »how-to instructions whole guides«, or just a lot of code
to see, which is of course a lot resourceful but also feels quite overwhelming


Also doesn't help at all when way too often a slight piece of understanding is missing
and the ADHD brain just *clicks* and starts looking for the ideal and "perfect" solutions,
and for that i thought to myself:
"mmhh well what if I try to just list the most i can by segments that can be easier to access
even for me when I'm on ADHD mode or just »looking for the "perfect" context piece«",
and so with that I started writing this post, which will be acting more like a segmented guide
that you can read all in order, or just cherry-pick your desired parts
