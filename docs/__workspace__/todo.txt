What to write about:
 - A language server made in Rust, a VSCode extensions, and pancakes( optionally :) )


It should have an introduction segment talking about what the post is about a bit,
then telling that it will be mostly section in an abstract way that certain aspects like
languages and tools can be replaced, but keep in mind that the primary ones are
Rust for the language server and VSCode extensions for the language client
(Look into Kate later if you feel like it, and consequentially JetBrains IDEs)

Note: Its important that i can polish as much as possible to be abstract but still informative enough
